    <h1><u>Vikramaditya</u></h1>
    <p><b>Vikramaditya</b> (IAST: Vikramāditya) was a legendary king as mentioned in ancient Indian literature, 
        featuring in traditional stories including those in <i>Vetala Panchavimshati and Singhasan Battisi.</i>
        Many describe him as ruler with his capital at Ujjain <mark>(Pataliputra or Pratishthana in a few stories)</mark>. 
        "Vikramaditya" was also a common title adopted by several <ins>monarchs in ancient and medieval India</ins>, and the 
        Vikramaditya legends may be embellished accounts of different kings</p>
        <p><strong>Gaha Sattasai</strong> (or Gatha-Saptasati), a collection of poems attributed to the Satavahana king Hāla 
            <del>(r. 20 – 24 CE)</del>, mentions a king named Vikramaditya who gave away his wealth out of charity. However, 
            many stanzas in this work are not common to its revisions and are apparent Gupta-period expansions.
            The verse about Vikramaditya is similar to a <mark>phrase—Anekago-shatasahasra-hiranya-kotipradasya—found </mark>in 
            Gupta inscriptions about <u>Samudragupta and Chandragupta II</u> (for example, the Pune and Riddhapur copper-plate 
            inscriptions of Chandragupta's daughter, Prabhavatigupta); this phrase may have been a later, Gupta-era 
            insertion in the work attributed to Hāla.</p>
